## Academic Background

I am a current PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University. My current work is focused on ameliorating the neuroinflammatory response to intracortical microelectrode implantation by targeting circulating immune cells. Relevant skills: animal handling, cell culture (macrophages), immunohistochemistry, ELISA, flow cytometry, multiphoton and confocal microscopy, multi-omics (Nanostring), Microsoft Office, undergraduate mentorship

I received my BSc in Chemical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. During this time, I was an undergraduate researcher in the Hanjaya-Putra Lab, investigating the differentiation of lymphatic endothelial cells for improved wound healing applications. Relevant skills: cell culture (lymphatic and blood endothelial cells, adult pluripotent stem cells), immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, Microsoft Office, PCR

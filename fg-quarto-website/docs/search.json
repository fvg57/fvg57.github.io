I am currently working on a project involving suppressing the bodyâ€™s immune response to electrodes implanted in the brain for use in recording and stimulating neurons. My approach is to target circulating immune cells to prevent them from recognizing damage signals.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions."

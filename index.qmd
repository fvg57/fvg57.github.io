# Welcome to this website!

My name is Francine Graham and I am a current PhD student at Case Western Reserve University in Biomedical Engineering. I am currently working on a project involving suppressing the body's immune response to electrodes implanted in the brain for use in recording and stimulating neurons. My approach is to target circulating immune cells to prevent them from recognizing damage signals.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:afg34@case.edu) if you have any questions.
